Mono works fine with most of the dependencies, even when compiled as 4.0, except for FluorineFXMods.
It needs to be compiled with the 2.0 project, otherwise it just hangs on connecting, it seems.

Certificates need to be imported manually like this:

yes | certmgr -ssl "https://lq.na1.lol.riotgames.com/login-queue/rest/queue"
yes | certmgr -ssl "rtmps://prod.na1.lol.riotgames.com:2099/"
yes | certmgr -ssl "https://lq.eu.lol.riotgames.com/login-queue/rest/queue"
yes | certmgr -ssl "rtmps://prod.eu.lol.riotgames.com:2099/"
yes | certmgr -ssl "https://lq.eun1.lol.riotgames.com/login-queue/rest/queue"
yes | certmgr -ssl "rtmps://prod.eun1.lol.riotgames.com:2099/"
